## *The Crowd Supply Guide:* Ordering, Paying, Shipping: The Details
-------------------

This page has all the details you need to know about doing business 
with Crowd Supply and supporting our creators’ projects.

### I have a problem with or question about a project

If you have a question about how something works or anything regarding 
the actual use and function of a project, you can communicate with 
creators directly by using the *"Ask [creator] a question"* button 
near the bottom of every campaign page. Many projects also have 
discussion forums where users can compare notes and troubleshoot. 
These are usually linked from the campaign page.  

Please note, if you have a question about a specific order placed on Crowd 
Supply, reach out directly to our [contact page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/contact) 
to ensure timely support. 

### How can I pay?

The easiest way to pay is with a credit card (Visa, MC, Amex, Discover). 
Under certain circumstances, we can also accept other forms of payment 
such as Bitcoin, PayPal, personal checks, cash, Automated Clearing House 
(ACH) transfers, and wire transfers (domestic and international). These 
alternate forms of payment may incur additional service charges and fees, 
and they may require pre-payment. To use them, you’ll need to [contact us](https://www.crowdsupply.com/alternative-payment-request). 

All campaigns are in US dollars (USD). We cannot accept foreign currencies 
and backers are responsible for any costs incurred in changing exchange rates.

### When will my order ship?

Every product lists an estimated ship date on the project's campaign page. You 
will receive an email confirmation, with tracking number, as soon as the item has been shipped. **The 
best way to find out the latest status of manufacturing and shipping is to check 
the "Updates" section of a project's campaign page.** This is preferable to 
emailing busy creators and their team.

In-stock items will typically ship within two business day from Crowd Supply's warehouse. 
For crowdfunding and pre-order items, the ship date is the creator's best 
estimate given manufacturing lead times and how many people have already 
ordered the product ahead of you.

Crowd Supply works with product creators to make crowdfunding and pre-order 
shipping estimates as accurate as possible, but there can sometimes be 
slippage in actual ship dates. Keep in mind these are products coming to 
market for the first time and there may be unforeseen delays. There can 
be parts shortages, design issues to correct, manufacturer delays, and 
shipping issues. 

For this reason, we strongly recommend that you do not support a campaign 
if you have a hard deadline for receiving the project you're supporting. 
Shipping dates are only estimates. Again, if you're wondering how a project 
is doing regarding shipping dates, check its *"Updates"* section for the 
latest information.

### Where can orders be shipped?

All Crowd Supply products ship free to the US. 

We will ship internationally anywhere we are legally allowed. International 
shipments are charged a flat fee that varies by the product. This fee is 
listed on the project page. **The package recipient will be responsible 
for any customs fees, duties, VAT, or other taxes that are incurred when 
receiving an overseas shipment.**

Packages shipped outside the United States can be tracked using the link 
included in the shipping confirmation e-mail and also listed under *“My 
Account”* on our website. 

### How will my order be shipped?

**The vast majority of domestic Crowd Supply orders are shipped via UPS.
** International orders will be shipped primarly via DHL or FedEx. If you 
require shipping by a different carrier, please let us know.

### If I order multiple items, can I combine and reduce shipping fees?

The short answer is no. Our shipping fees are based on the actual costs of 
shipping (size, weight, insurance fees, etc.), so those costs increase if 
the number of items increases.

### How can I change my shipping or billing address?

You can change your shipping address by going to [your Crowd Supply account](https://www.crowdsupply.com/account) 
page, choosing the open order you want to change the address for, and 
then clicking the *“Update Shipping Address”* button. You will need to 
[log in](https://www.crowdsupply.com/login) before accessing your account.

If your billing address changes during the course of the campaign, as 
long as your transaction has been processed, there is no need to change 
it. If we encounter any issues processing a transaction due to a mis-matched 
address, we will email you a notification explaining the issue.

### Where do orders ship from?

**All orders fulfilled directly by Crowd Supply ship from our distribution center in 
Mansfield, TX, USA.** Some creators choose to do order fulfillment themselves. 
Those orders typically ship from wherever the manufacturer or creator is located. 
In practice, however, the vast majority of orders ship from Texas.


### Shipping Confirmation & Status
You will receive an email confirmation once the item has been shipped with the 
details of the order and a tracking number for the package. Use this to track 
the package with the carrier's website. You can also check the status of your 
orders by logging into your Crowd Supply account and going to *“My Account”*. 
Accounts are created automatically when you make a pledge or place an order.

### How Do I Get an Invoice for My Order?

We will include a printed invoice along with your shipped order. You can also 
view and/or print an order any time by going to [your account page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/account) 
and selecting the order. Lastly, your order confirmation email can also 
serve as an invoice. If you need something beyond this, please contact us.

### Can I cancel my order?

You can cancel a crowdfunding item any time before a campaign reaches its funding 
goal. After a campaign ends, cancellations are left up to the discretion of the 
creator. In practice, creators usually allow cancellations. In-stock orders and 
pre-orders can be cancelled if they haven’t shipped yet. Please email us at 
<orders@crowdsupply.com> and be sure to include your order number. Please refer 
to this [Guide Page on Backer Protection](https://www.crowdsupply.com/guide/backer-protection#terms-and-policies-return-refund-cancellation-lost-packages) 
for the details of our return/refund policies.

### What happens if a campaign does not meet its goal?

Your card will not be charged in any way. If you used an alternate form of payment, 
you will receive a refund. We will contact you to arrange the details of that refund.

### Unclaimed & Returned Packages

Packages returned to Crowd Supply because they went unclaimed or had an invalid address 
will be returned to inventory. A refund will be issued, minus any shipping fees, to the 
customer. You will be notified of the returned package, the refund, and directed to place 
a new order if you'd still like to receive the package. 



### What can I do if a project I want is "unavailable"?

Some projects on Crowd Supply are no longer available. There are several reasons 
why this might be the case. The product may simply be out of stock, the creator 
may no longer be manufacturing it, or there may be shortages or other issues 
that are impacting manufacture. If you want to be notified if and when a product 
will be in stock again, sign up for "Updates" on the campaign page.
