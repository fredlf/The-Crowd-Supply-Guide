##*The Crowd Supply Guide:* Your Campaign Has Ended, Now What?
---------------

There are three ways a campaign can end: funded, unfunded, or suspended. Below, we describe what happens and what you need to do for each scenario.

###After a Campaign Funds Successfully 

####Stuff Crowd Supply Will Do

Here’s what you can expect from Crowd Supply when your campaign successfully funds.

* **Order Information:** Crowd Supply will provide you with a spreadsheet containing all the info from your backers (what they ordered, their shipping info, email address, etc.). 

* **Transfer of Funds:** Crowd Supply will send you the funds collected from your backers. Note that if your campaign has reached its funding goal before the campaign’s end-date you have the option of collecting your funds then or waiting until the official end-date. While it can be advantageous to access the capital early (e.g., you can start manufacturing earlier), there are also downsides such as incurring multiple banking transaction fees or more complex tax liabilities and accounting. For details on fees and pricing, see the [“How are Funds Received?” page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/guide/how-are-funds-received). 

* **Transition to Pre-order:** Crowd Supply will make some changes to your campaign page. Specifically, your crowdfunding page will get archived under the “history” tab on the campaign page. It will be replaced with the “available” page (which, of course, can be modified as you see fit). Note that the URL to your page will NOT change. We will also change the pricing to the pre-order rates you chose.

* **Fulfillment Preparation:** If you are using Crowd Supply for your fulfillment services, as soon as we receive product from you, we will start shipping orders to your backers first, and then to anyone who placed a pre-order. There are a few details you’ll need to take care of to get shipping started:
Determine the correct [“Harmonized System” codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System) for the product (your manufacturer may be able to help with this)
Finalize packaging
Coordinate product delivery to us, including payment for any tariffs, customs, etc.

#### Stuff You Need To Do

You’ve hit a big milestone, but there’s still lots for you to do:

* You should have been working all along to ensure your manufacturing plan is on track and that product will available when you’ve said it would be. In any case, you’ll want to issue an update with projected ship dates very soon so that backers know when to expect their stuff.

* If you’re not using Crowd Supply for shipping and fulfillment, there’s a long list of things you need to do to get the right stuff to the right person, too long to enumerate here. The main takeaway is to not underestimate the time and effort it will take to fulfill the orders and keep up to date your record keeping and invoicing.

###After Your Campaign Fails to Fund or Is Suspended

So the end date of your campaign came, or you decided to suspend it, and you did not meet your funding goal. Don’t be downcast, you’ve actually accomplished a lot. You can take what you learned about your project and your supporters and use the information to modify your project, your outreach, and/or your price points and manufacturing plans. You probably also received some invaluable feedback from backers and you started to build a community who can help you launch another project.

####Stuff Crowd Supply Will Do

Here’s what you can expect from Crowd Supply:

* Backers will not be charged anything.
* While we do not release individual backer data, you will be able to update your backers to let them know your status.
* The status of your campaign page will be changed to “Funding Unsuccessful” or “Suspended”. The page will continue to be accessible at the same URL, but will no longer be listed in our “browse” section. In the interests of transparency, we will not take down any campaign pages. Doing so would be re-writing history and would send the message that we don't stand by our work.
* We’ll send you a post-campaign exit survey to help understand what happened and help us improve.

####Stuff You Need To Do

There are just a few loose strings you’ll need to tie up.

* You will need to publish an update to thank backers, let them know the campaign did not successfully fund, and tell them your plans for the future, as you see fit.
* If you sent us any prototypes or other materials for creating videos, images, etc., be sure  to arrange for their return.
