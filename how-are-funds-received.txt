##*Crowd Supply Guide:* How are Funds Received?
--------------------

**Your success is our success.** We don't make money unless you do.

------------------------------------

Crowd Supply follows an all-or-nothing funding model. If your campaign meets its goal, then you get all the money raised, less fees. Otherwise, no one is charged.


## Timing
You'll receive funds from your campaign's backers at four times:

1. As soon as your campaign hits its funding goal, the pledges up until that point will be batch processed. You should receive funds (less applicable fees) within 10 days
1. The balance of remaining pledges will be processed as soon as your funded campaign ends. You will receive funds (less applicable fees) within 10 days
1. Once you fulfill all the orders from your original campaign, you will receive funds (less applicable fees) from the pre-orders placed since the campaign concluded.
1. Whenever Crowd Supply decides it needs to refill its own inventory of your product

These are general timelines and are subject to change with the particulars of each campaign. To learn more, please visit the [When are Funds Received? page](/guide/when-are-funds-received).

## Fees
Crowd Supply's fee structure is straightforward:

* Credit card processing fee: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
* Crowdfunding fee: depending on your [service plan](/launch#pricing), 5-15% of total pledged during your campaign
* Pre-order fee: optional; 10% of total pledged after your campaign ends
* Fulfillment fee: optional; see [Fulfillment and Logistics](/guide/fulfillment-and-logistics) for more details
* If a campaign does not reach its funding goal, no money is collected and no fees charged

## Payment Methods: Options & Timing

We offer three different options for receiving your campaign funds. Please carefully read about each option below and let us know which you prefer.

### Automated Clearing House (ACH)

ACH transfers are an efficient and inexpensive way to receive funds from Crowd Supply into a US-based bank account. There is a one-time setup process which takes two to three business days to complete, but all transfers thereafter occur within a single business day. Crowd Supply does not charge a fee for ACH transfers. To set up ACH transfers, you will need to provide Crowd Supply with:

- Bank name
- Bank routing number
- Account holder name
- Account number

### Paper Check

To receive your project funds via a paper check sent through the US Postal Service, please provide Crowd Supply with the following details:

- Name to make the check out to
- Mailing address

Check payments sent to US addresses typically arrive in 7-10 business days.

### Wire Transfer

You can also request to be paid via wire. However, you are responsible for all outgoing wire fees from Crowd Supply. Domestic transfers incur a $25 fee. International transfers incur a $40 fee. All international wire transfers require a single test transfer before the full amount is transferred. The below wire information will need to be completed and sent to Crowd Supply to initiate the wire.

#### US Domestic Wires

* Bank name
* Bank address
* SWIFT code or routing number
* Account holder name
* Account holder address
