## *The Crowd Supply Guide:* Supporting Crowd Supply Projects
-------------------

By making a purchase on Crowd Supply, you are helping a project come to life that might not otherwise have seen the light of day. There are three ways to make a purchase:

1. **Crowdfunding**: Making a pledge during a project's crowdfunding campaign means you are pre-paying for a product that doesn't exist yet. You will only be charged once the project reaches its funding goal, which may be before the end of the campaign. If the project does not reach its funding goal, you WILL NOT be charged. Crowdfunding campaigns usually last 30-60 days.

    Funded projects go on to use the collected funds to manufacture the first batch and ship your order as soon as it's ready, at which point you will receive a shipping confirmation email. Campaign backers often enjoy special pricing, access to limited edition versions, and other perks.

2. **Pre-order**: After a crowdfunding campaign has successfully ended, you can still place a pre-order to reserve your spot in line while the first batch is being manufactured. Pre-orders are filled after crowdfunding orders, but often still offer a discount from the eventual retail price. Pre-orders are only available for a limited time, before the project becomes available as a regular, in-stock item. 

3. **In-stock**: Once a project has successfully manufactured and shipped its first batch of products to its crowdfunding and pre-order customers, Crowd Supply will often purchase inventory and resell it just like any other online store. In-stock orders usually ship directly from Crowd Supply's warehouse within one business day. In-stock products are available for sale until inventory runs out.

## Help the Community

A crowd-funding pledge or pre-order is more than just a purchase, it's a commitment and an endorsement. When you back a campaign, you're saying you believe in the merits of the project and, despite a small amount of risk, you want to help it come to fruition. You can also help the project succeed by sharing it with friends and co-workers and talking about it in online communities you belong to or in clubs, professional meetings, or social groups. The more exposure a project gets, the more likely it is to fund and, just as importantly, the more feedback and review it will get. That helps build better projects. (Tip: a Crowd Supply project URL never changes, regardless of what stage the project is in. It will always be "crowdsupply.com/awesome-project", so it's easy to remember and share.)


## Ordering, Paying, Shipping: The Details

### How can I pay?

The easiest way to pay is with a credit card (Visa, MC, Amex, Discover). Under certain circumstances, we can also accept other forms of payment such as Bitcoin, PayPal, personal checks, cash, Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, and wire transfers (domestic and international). These alternate forms of payment may incur additional service charges and fees, and they may require pre-payment. To use them, you’ll need to contact us at <orders@crowdsupply.com>.

All campaigns are in US dollars (USD). We cannot accept foreign currencies and backers are responsible for any costs incurred in changing exchange rates.

### When will my order ship?

Every product lists an estimated ship date on the project's campaign page. You will receive an email confirmation as soon as the item has been shipped. **The best way to find out the latest status of manufacturing and shipping is to check the "Updates" section of a project's campaign page.** This is preferable to emailing busy creators and their team.

In-stock items will ship within one business day from Crowd Supply's warehouse. For crowdfunding and pre-order items, the ship date is the creator's best estimate given manufacturing lead times and how many people have already ordered the product ahead of you.

Crowd Supply works with product creators to make crowdfunding and pre-order shipping estimates as accurate as possible, but there can sometimes be slippage in actual ship dates. Keep in mind these are products coming to market for the first time and there may be unforeseen delays. There can be parts shortages, design issues to correct, manufacturer delays, and shipping issues. 

For this reason, we strongly recommend that you do not support a campaign if you have a hard deadline for receiving the project you're supporting. Shipping dates are only estimates. Again, if you're wondering how a project is doing regarding shipping dates, check its "Updates" section for the latest information.

### Where can orders be shipped?

All Crowd Supply products ship free to the US. 

We will ship internationally anywhere we are legally allowed. International shipments are charged a flat fee that varies by the product. This fee is listed on the project page. **The package recipient will be responsible for any customs fees, duties, VAT, or other taxes that are incurred when receiving an overseas shipment.**

Packages shipped outside the United States can be tracked using the link included in the shipping confirmation e-mail and also listed under “My Account” on our website. For packages sent via USPS (our usual carrier), tracking information is sometimes available only until the package leaves the US, at which point tracking information may be available through the destination country’s USPS partner carrier using the same tracking number. If no tracking information is available with the partner carrier, you should check with your local customs house to see if the package is being held. Most customs houses hold packages for only a certain amount of time before returning them to the sender as unclaimed.

### How will my order be shipped?

**The vast majority of Crowd Supply orders are shipped via the US Postal Service (USPS).** Some larger/heavier items may go out United Parcel Service (UPS). If you require shipping by a different carrier, please let us know.

### If I order multiple items, can I combine and reduce shipping fees?

The short answer is no. Our shipping fees are based on the actual costs of shipping (size, weight, insurance fees, etc.), so those costs increase if the number of items increases.

### How can I change my shipping or billing address?

You can change your shipping address by going to [your Crowd Supply account](https://www.crowdsupply.com/account) page, choosing the open order you want to change the address for, and then clicking the “Update Shipping Address” button. You will need to [log in](https://www.crowdsupply.com/login) before accessing your account.

If your billing address changes during the course of the campaign, as long as your transaction has been processed, there is no need to change it. If we encounter any issues processing a transaction due to a mis-matched address, we will email you a notification explaining the issue.

### Where do orders ship from?

**All orders fulfilled directly by Crowd Supply ship from our warehouse in Portland, OR, USA.** Some creators choose to do order fulfillment themselves. Those orders typically ship from wherever the manufacturer or creator is located. In practice, however, the vast majority of orders ship from Portland.


### Shipping Confirmation & Status
You will receive an email confirmation once the item has been shipped with the details of the order and a tracking number for the package. Use this to track the package with the carrier's website (usually, www.usps.com). You can also check the status of your orders by logging into your Crowd Supply account and going to “My Account.” Accounts are created automatically when you make a pledge or place an order.

### How Do I Get an Invoice for My Order?

We will include a printed invoice along with your shipped order. You can also view and/or print an order any time by going to [your account page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/account) and selecting the order. Lastly, your order confirmation email can also serve as an invoice. If you need something beyond this, please contact us.

### Tracking International Orders

In some cases, tracking information for international orders will not update once the package leaves the US. It’s not uncommon to see a package “stall” for a period of several weeks while it is in fact still in transit to its destination. Similarly, international packages may get held up by customs and/or local post offices and the tracking info will simply say “delivered". You may be able to get better tracking info on local carriers from a third-party tracking service such as [Aftership.com](https://www.aftership.com/courier) or [www.trackitonline.ru](http://www.trackitonline.ru/).

If a long period of time has passed without a tracking update, we strongly suggest you contact your local post office or customs agency *before* contacting us. Typically, we cannot do much or get access to additional info once a package leaves the US. Note that shipping to some regions can take as long as six weeks.

### Can I cancel my order?

You can cancel a crowdfunding item any time before a campaign reaches its funding goal. After a campaign ends, cancellations are left up to the discretion of the creator. In practice, creators usually allow cancellations. In-stock orders and pre-orders can be cancelled if they haven’t shipped yet. Please email us at <orders@crowdsupply.com> and be sure to include your order number. Please refer to this [Guide Page on Backer Protection](https://www.crowdsupply.com/guide/backer-protection#terms-and-policies) for the details of our return/refund policies.

### What happens if a campaign does not meet its goal?

Your card will not be charged in any way. If you used an alternate form of payment, you will receive a refund. We will contact you to arrange the details of that refund.

###Unclaimed & Returned Packages

Packages returned to sender because they went unclaimed or had an invalid address will be held for up to 90 days. During this time the sender, whether Crowd Supply or the manufacturer, will make a good-faith attempt to contact the intended recipient and arrange an alternate shipping solution. The recipient will be charged for all freight and other fees incurred for re-sending the package. If the recipient cannot be reached or does not agree to an alternative shipping solution within 90 days of the package being returned, the recipient forfeits any claim to the package or a refund.
