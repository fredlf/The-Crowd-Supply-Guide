##*The Crowd Supply Guide:* Campaign Content Checklist

------------------------

Crowd Supply will work with creators from anywhere in the world, but for everyone, the process is the same. So, here's a comprehensive list of everything you will need to do to launch your campaign on Crowd Supply once you have a signed SoW in place with us. One of our campaign experts will work with you to create and gather this information, turn it into a private campaign page for your review, and refine the campaign page and collateral until it is ready for launch.

Obviously, in order to complete many of the tasks on this list, you'll need to have some sort of prototype in hand.

For detailed information, guidelines, and tips on creating this content, visit the [Campaign Content Basics page](/guide/campaign-content-basics).
